This screenshot captures my detailed involvement in managing and diagnosing a high-impact service ticket. After assigning the ticket to myself and updating the SLA to SAV-A (1 hour - Active) due to customer-facing issues, I documented key actions and observations within the ticket threath.

This screenshot shows the final stage of an incident management process, where I communicated the resolution of a high-priority issue to the affected user. After identifying a recent update as the root cause of the online banking outage, I initiated a rollback to restore functionality.

This screenshot illustrates the final step in the incident lifecycle: officially closing ticket #424552 after successfully resolving the reported issue. Once the root cause was addressed and the system was confirmed to be functioning correctly, I updated the ticket status to "Resolved."
